Building MRP Sequencer and MRPShell
-----------------------------------

You will need Qt installed (www.trolltech.com) in order to
build MRP Sequencer.  If you do not have Qt installed, you
can still build MRPShell.  



To build everything and run MRP Sequencer:

  make && cd gshell && make test


To build and run just MRPShell:

  cd midicl && make && cd ../seq && make && cd ../shell && make && bin/MRPShell



(Note: If you are going to be building the binary
distribution, build only the static version of the Qt
library.)

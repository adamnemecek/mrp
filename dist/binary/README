MRP Sequencer  -  1.0.0
======================================


* a simple example:

1 mrp> ports
output port 0 is SimpleSynth virtual input
2 mrp> newtrack
added track 1
3 mrp> selecttrack 1
selected track 1
4 mrp> randomnote
randomised note on 16 selections
base note C-1 range 127 note
5 mrp> play


* run 'ports' to see a list available MIDI output ports


* run 'help' to see a list of commands


* key controls for modifying the current selection when
  key focus is in the track display:

  note -- q w  e r -- velocity
  port -- a s  d f -- gate
  chan -- z x

  NOTE: don't get too attached to these keybindings; they
  are experimental and are going to be replaced with
  something much better soon.
